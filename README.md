# project9

Study the examples (squid1, squid3, squid5),  
then create a new program (squid9.java)  
that adds an array of boats (at least four),  
and keys (or buttons) to do the following:

  -- 'B' key sorts the boats in order of position (x).  
  -- 'D' key sorts the boats in order of speed (dx).  
  -- 'F' key sorts the boats in order of greatest cargo.  

  -- 'X' key sorts the squids in order of position (x).  
  -- 'Y' key sorts the squids in order of height (y).  
  -- 'S' key sorts the squids in order of speed (dy).  
  -- 'L' key sorts the squids in order of legs.
